# TicTacToe-Website
My first own website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript. The idea came from the front end mentor, but I one must have
premium account to access the resources. I only got the concept through the project preview and made my own specifications
base on my own idea. I also customized the components. The CSS design mostly came from the project preview. You can visit

## Welcome
At the moment I am creating this website, I am learning different JavaScript frameworks as well as CSS frameworks.
To have fun and have a break at the same time, I exercised my basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. If you are a developer,
I'd be glad if you can check this project and have some recommendations on how to improve it. Please do not hesitate to 
give any commendations about this project. You can see my contacts below.

## Specifications
### HTML
  - No issues.
### CSS
  - At this moment, I don't have much knowledge on flexbox and grids in CSS. 
  - I only know basic CSS and Bootstrap. However, I did not use bootstrap as well to exercise my CSS skills.
### JavaScript
  - I practiced Vanilla in this project. However, I already know the basics of jQuery.
  - You may see bad code or bruteforce solution.
  - You may see lots of repetitive code.

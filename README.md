# TicTacToe-Website
My first own website using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

## Welcome
At the moment I am creating this website, I am learning different JavaScript frameworks as well as CSS frameworks.
To have fun and have a break at the same time, I exercised my basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills. If you are a developer,
I'd be glad if you can check this project and have some recommendations on how to improve it. Please do not hesitate to 
give any commendations about this project. 

## Specifications
### HTML
  - No issues.
### CSS
  - At this moment, I don't have much knowledge on flexbox and grids in CSS. 
  - I only know basic CSS and Bootstrap. However, I did not use bootstrap as well to exercise my CSS skills.
### JavaScript
  - I practiced Vanilla in this project. However, I already know the basics of jQuery.
  - You may see bad code or bruteforce solution.
  - You may see lots of repetitive code.
